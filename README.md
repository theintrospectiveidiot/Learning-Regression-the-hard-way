## Learning Regression the hard way

This repository was created while experimenting and implementing Regression algorithms from scratch in C using Gradient descent.

I made this primarily to experiment while reading "Grokking Machine Learning" by Luis G. Serrano.

For vizualisation purpose, I've used **GNUplot 6** to you know, stay in the C ecosystem. Earlier, I used to export these coeeficients data into a python 
file and then use **matplotlib** to plot the graph, but I started using **GNUplot 6** the moment I discovered it.

The purpose of this whole thing is to understand what is really happening in Regression, instead of just writing model.fit(), I just went a little
adventurous and just wrote in a low level language like C.


## Notes
- This is solely an experimental learning repository.
- The Code prioritizes clarity and understanding over performance and efficiency.
